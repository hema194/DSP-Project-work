data processing
1.We can find the dimensions of the data set using the panda dataset ‘shape’
2.Cancer data set dimensions : (569, 32)

3.Diagnosis’ is the column which we are going to predict , 
which says if the cancer is M = malignant or B = benign.
 1 means the cancer is malignant and 0 means benign. We can identify that out of the 569 persons, 357 are labeled as B (benign) and 212 as M (malignant).

We can find any missing or null data points of the data set (if there is any) using
